# Background
sok-ha is a Home Assistant custom integration written in Python. Its purpose is to connect to SOK LiFePO4 batteries over Bluetooth low energy and send and receive data. sok-ha is the Home Assistant integration â€“ it handles scanning for devices and managing the devices and associated data in Home Assistant. sok-ha itself uses the [sok-ble library](https://github.com/IAmTheMitchell/sok-ble) to handle the Bluetooth low energy communication with the batteries. sok-ble actually sends, receives, and parses the data from the batteries. sok-ble is a separate Python package that can be used independently of sok-ha and is not included in the sok-ha repository.
